While this is crawling a site providing general statistics/information about
US colleges, the primary focus of this class is simply to practice a set of
skills:
    * collecting and parsing data
    * unit testing/code maintainability
    * logging/handling errors

Also, this was originally started when I had access to their site map ;)
Apparently more that just me have been hitting their site and they've
taken the thing down, so a more sophisticated approach would probably
be necessary to actually make this scraper functional.
